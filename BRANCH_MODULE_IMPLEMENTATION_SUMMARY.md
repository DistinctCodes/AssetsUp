# Branch Module Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the Branch Module for the backend system. Branches represent different physical locations of a company (e.g., Lagos HQ, Abuja Branch). Each branch can have departments, users, and assets assigned to it.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Branch Entity
- **File**: `backend/src/branches/entities/branch.entity.ts`
- **Fields**:
  - `id`: Primary key (auto-generated)
  - `name`: Branch name (string, required)
  - `address`: Branch address (string, optional)
  - `companyId`: Foreign key to Company (integer, required)
  - `createdAt`: Creation timestamp
  - `updatedAt`: Last update timestamp
- **Relationships**:
  - Many-to-One with Company
  - One-to-Many with Department
  - One-to-Many with Asset

### 2. DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
- **CreateBranchDto**: For creating new branches
- **UpdateBranchDto**: For updating existing branches

### 3. Service Layer
- **File**: `backend/src/branches/branches.service.ts`
- **Methods**:
  - `create()`: Create a new branch
  - `findAll()`: Get all branches
  - `findByCompany()`: Get branches for a specific company
  - `findOne()`: Get a branch by ID
  - `update()`: Update a branch
  - `remove()`: Delete a branch
  - `getBranchStats()`: Get statistics for a branch (department count, asset count)

### 4. Controller Layer
- **File**: `backend/src/branches/branches.controller.ts`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /branches`: Create a new branch
  - `GET /branches`: Get all branches
  - `GET /branches/company/:companyId`: Get branches for a company
  - `GET /branches/:id`: Get a branch by ID
  - `GET /branches/:id/stats`: Get branch statistics
  - `PATCH /branches/:id`: Update a branch
  - `DELETE /branches/:id`: Delete a branch

### 5. Module Configuration
- **File**: `backend/src/branches/branches.module.ts`
- Imports all required entities and configures the module

### 6. Entity Relationships
Updated related entities to establish proper relationships:

#### Department Entity
- Added `branchId` field
- Added Many-to-One relationship with Branch

#### Asset Entity
- Added `assignedBranchId` field
- Added Many-to-One relationship with Branch

### 7. Comprehensive Testing
- **File**: `backend/src/branches/branches.service.comprehensive.spec.ts`
- Tests cover all service methods including:
  - Success cases
  - Error handling (NotFoundException, ConflictException)
  - Edge cases
  - Relationship handling

## Features Implemented
1. ✅ Branches table linked to companies
2. ✅ CRUD APIs for branches
3. ✅ Relationship with departments
4. ✅ Relationship with assets
5. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
6. ✅ Error handling for edge cases
7. ✅ Proper validation and documentation

## API Endpoints
- `POST /branches` - Create a new branch
- `GET /branches` - Get all branches
- `GET /branches/company/:companyId` - Get branches for a company
- `GET /branches/:id` - Get a branch by ID
- `GET /branches/:id/stats` - Get branch statistics
- `PATCH /branches/:id` - Update a branch
- `DELETE /branches/:id` - Delete a branch

## Testing
The comprehensive test suite ensures:
- All CRUD operations work correctly
- Error cases are properly handled
- Relationships are correctly managed
- Statistics are calculated accurately
